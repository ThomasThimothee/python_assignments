How to run the program - clone the project on your local machine and in your command prompt
type the following: python korean_conflict_plots.py

notes: our program gives as output several graphs as well as a text output in the command prompt / terminal. The display of each graph is a "blocking call" meaning that you will need to close the diagram window in order to see the next one. Stretch-out the window of the graphs to see more clearly the information displayed.


Q2: Which enrollment was the most common?
A: We've decided to display our data with the bar graph for this question as the bar graph is the best for comparing things between two different groups.
From the output graph we can conclude that the most common enrollment was active - regular, followed by selected service and active - guard/reserve.

Q3: Was there an ethnicity majority throughout the war - If so, which?
A: Using the pie chart here is quite logical as we're trying to compare parts of a whole, to be more precise we've used pie chart because we can display all the ethnicities in one pie chart while separating each individual ethnicity and showing its percentage.
We came to a conclusion that the whites have played the major role in the war with 81.3%, followed by american indians(9%) and african americans(8.7%)

Q4: Which division had the most casualties?
A: For this question, we have decided that it is the best to display the divisions with casualties over 100 as there was too much data otherwise and the bar graph didn't look nice.
The results were mixed, some divisions such as 38 INF 2 DIV had casualties as high as 1750, whereas some of them stayed in the lower 200's (160 INF 40 DIV)

Q5: Which Home state suffered the most losses?
A: Same as the previous question, we took states with more than 100 casualties per state. The bar graph was used as the previous question is almost the same as this one, only the parameters have been changed.
The state with the most causalites was Arizona(2500+), followed by Pennsylvania(2500-), New York (2500-), whereas the states with the least ammount of casualties were Montana and Utah(around 200 causalties)
